# WüSpace Template Repository

Wondering where the Pull Request template comes from? \
Here's the answer! :wink:

## Template workflows

Do you have a nice crafted GitHub Actions workflow and want to share it in the organization?

Simply put your workflow file into the `template-workflows` directory,
give it a `<workflow-name>.properties.json`
and select one of our nice icons from the `template-workflows/icons` folder.

Open a Pull Request and we will take a look!
